## 🚀 Live Demo

| | URL |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | https://eduflow-frontend-zkjx.onrender.com |
| **Backend API** | https://eduflow-backend-2ztt.onrender.com/api/health |

> Hosted on Render's free tier — the backend spins down after inactivity, so the first request after idle time can take 30–50 seconds to wake up.

### Demo Login

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@eduflow.com` | `password123` |
| Instructor | `instructor@eduflow.com` | `password123` |
| Student | `student@eduflow.com` | `password123` |

Seeded via `npm run seed` in the backend.
